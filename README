GRAVE --> Algorithm for a bookmaker.

Basic Overview:

    Bets for the same game, for the same type (spread, O/U), will be matched up.
    Those that cannot be matched up, in the case where there is no bet on the
    opposite side with the same value, will remain "open". They will remain
    open because another bettor may want to take the other side of this bet.

    So, if Garry places a bet for 200$ on the under for the Celtics vs. Raptors
    game and there are no open bets on the over side for the Celtics vs. Raptors
    game, then Garry's bet would remain open. 

    **The term "open" is defined as such--Garry's bet is now in the system.
        If Janet places a bet on the opposite side (the over) for 100$, then
        Garry would have a bet of 100$ still open. Garry will have the option to
        remove the remaining open bet at any time.
    
    All open bets will be displayed so that clients can see what bets can be
    immediately locked into the book. 
    
    There is no commision for the book. Obviously this is all hypothetical
    and no real money or outside users are involved. But, this program is
    supposed to represent a betting platform with no middle man, no juice, 
    no commision.

Maybe use readaline, have type of bet before the line/description
        so that we know how much to "malloc". Use split function also?

Overall design & data structures:
    What would I use C for? C++ for?
    
    Output: total made by the book, bets rejected (full username, etc.), total $ in bets places,

    later implement a GUI?
        **See example before for how GUI would look.

Example:
    file.txt:
-->FORMAT: Game, odds + type + additional information, Bettor's pick, Bettor's bet<--
        Celtics vs. Raptors, -110 spread (-2.5), Celtics, $100
        Celtics vs. Raptors, -110 spread (-2.5), Raptors, $100
        Celtics vs. Raptors, -110 O/U 114.5, Over, -110, $100
        Celtics vs. Raptors, -110 O/U 114.5, Over, -110, $100
        Celtics vs. Raptors, -110 O/U 114.5, Under, -110, $200

Matching C and C++:
    Compile C programs...
        gcc -c -o somecode.o somecode.c
    Compile C++ programs...
        g++ -c -o othercode.o othercode.cpp
