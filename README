Algorithm to match

Maybe use readaline, have type of bet before the line/description
        so that we know how much to "malloc". Use split function also?

Overall design:
    Use C to gather arrays, use Hansons stuff (atoms, tables) to organize data
    like organizing bets by game, then by parlay (although probably won't) deal
    with that. 

    What do I use c++ for?
    
    
    Output: total made by the book, bets rejected (full username, etc.), total $ in bets places,

        later implement a GUI?


Matching C and C++:
    Compile C programs...
        gcc -c -o somecode.o somecode.c
    Compile C++ programs...
        g++ -c -o othercode.o othercode.cpp
